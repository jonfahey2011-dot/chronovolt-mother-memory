# ChronoVolt Clean Directive Pack

This pack contains the cleaned **rules + manifest + verified structure** after consolidation.

## Files
- `manifest.json` → authoritative manifest (post-cleanup)
- `rules.md` → human-readable directive rules
- `_VERIFIED_STRUCTURE_OUTPUT.txt` → snapshot of verified structure

## How to apply
1. Extract this ZIP somewhere safe.
2. Copy `manifest.json` into your project root (or `Docs/Master_Rules/` if you want rules colocated).
3. Copy `rules.md` into `Docs/Master_Rules/`.
4. Keep `_VERIFIED_STRUCTURE_OUTPUT.txt` in `QA_&_Verification/` as your reference proof.

## Notes
- These are **drop-in replacements/new files**. No need to edit.
- Always run validation scripts before packaging.
